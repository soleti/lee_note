\section{Introduction}
One of the main physics goals of the MicroBooNE experiment is to clarify the nature of the low-energy excess of $\nu_{e}$-like events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment in 2009 \cite{miniboone}. The excess was found in the neutrino energy region between 200 to 475 MeV.

However, the MiniBooNE detector was a \v{C}erenkov detector, which is not able to distinguish between single electrons and single photons in the final state, making it impossible to pick a physics model among those which could explain the excess.

The MicroBooNE detector, instead, is a liquid argon time projection chamber. This technology provides detailed tracking and allows to measure the rate of energy loss per length of each particle ($dE/dx$), which is essential for electron/photon identification.

In this note we will describe an algorithm which aims to select $\nu_{e}$ interactions in the MicroBooNE detector in a $\nu_{\mu}$ beam, such as the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.
